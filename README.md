Real-time Emotion Detection: Analyze text and identify emotions instantly.
Multi-Emotion Support: Recognizes a variety of emotions including joy, sadness, anger, fear, and others.
Customizable API Integration: Users can easily integrate their own IBM Watson NLU credentials.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
NLP Service: IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding
HTTP Requests: requests library

Installation
To set up this project locally:

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detector.git
cd emotion-detector

Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

Install the dependencies:
bash
pip install requests

Set up IBM Watson API credentials:
Sign up for an IBM Cloud account and create an instance of the Watson Natural Language Understanding service.
Obtain your API key and URL.
Replace the placeholders in the emotion_detector() function with your credentials:
url = 'https://api.your-region.natural-language-understanding.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/your-instance-id/v1/analyze?version=2021-08-01'
api_key = 'your_api_key_here'

Run the application:
You can test the emotion detector by running the script and passing a sample text to the emotion_detector() function.
bash
python your_script_name.py

Usage
Open the Python script.
Replace the text variable with the text you want to analyze.
Run the script to see the detected emotions in the console.

Example:
text = "I'm feeling really happy today!"
result = emotion_detector(text)
if result:
    print(result)

This will output something like:

{
    "anger": 0.02,
    "disgust": 0.01,
    "fear": 0.15,
    "joy": 0.60,
    "sadness": 0.05,
    "dominant_emotion": "joy"
}
